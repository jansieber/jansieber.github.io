<ul>
<li>Title: Thermalisation in weakly nonlinear chains</li>
<li>Speaker: Davide Proment (University of East Anglia)</li>
<li>Date: Thursday 30 Sep 2020 16:00 – 17:00 (zoom link tba)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="courses">Courses</h3>
<p>These courses offer lectures on specialised mathematical topics (<a href="#lectures">see below</a>) to PGR students at 21 UK Universities. The lectures are delivered by a member of staff from one of the participating universities. Students attend the lectures via zoom.</p>
<h3 id="credit">Credit</h3>
<p>Each course can count toward the compulsory training if you submit and pass a pass/fail take-home exam at the end of the course. See <a href="https://maths-magic.ac.uk/calendar.php">maths-magic.ac.uk/calendar.php</a> for exam periods.</p>
<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>
<p><strong>MAGIC</strong> You will be automatically registered for MAGIC, such that you are able to login to the <a href="https://maths-magic.ac.uk/" class="uri">maths-magic.ac.uk</a> website. </p>
<p>    <strong>Courses</strong> You can then enrol for courses. For each course you can enrol for participation only (such that it does not count as credit) or for participation and assessment.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-software-instructions">Hardware &amp; software instructions</h3>
<p>All lectures are broadcast using zoom. You can connect to the lecture using a personal account given to you when after you registered for MAGIC. The lectures require authentication such that you cannot just join by clicking on a link.</p>
<p> 
<p>For each course you plan to attend:</p>
<ul>
<li>enrol on <a href="http://maths-magic.ac.uk" class="uri">http://maths-magic.ac.uk</a></li>
<li>choose if you intend to get assessed (this can be changed at a later date, before the exam period)</li>
<li>attend the lecture(s) as scheduled each week</li>
<li>after each lecture tick a box on maths-magic, confirming that you attended (for attendance monitoring)</li>
</ul>
<!--<h3 id="request">Request</h3>
<p>Please make sure that you physically attend the lectures in St. John’s room for courses that you enrolled in. We block-book the rooms for all times for which students are registered. Colleagues in engineering residing in Kay Building have complained in the past when we book the room for times when nobody shows up.</p>

<li>[<strong>first point of call</strong>] Jan Sieber (node representative, <a href="mailto:j.sieber@exeter.ac.uk" class="email">j.sieber@exeter.ac.uk</a>, Office Harrison Building 315)</li>
<li>Samantha Blackburn (part-time, <a href="mailto:s.e.blackburn@exeter.ac.uk" class="email">s.e.blackburn@exeter.ac.uk</a>, administor coordinating MAGIC for the entire UK network)</li>
<li>Prof. Peter Ashwin (UK wide MAGIC director, <a href="mailto:p.ashwin@exeter.ac.uk" class="email">p.ashwin@exeter.ac.uk</a>, Office Harrison Building 338)</li>
</ul>
<p>Jan Sieber has a back-up laptop equipped for attending MAGIC lectures in his office (H315).</p>
<!--<p><strong>Technical warning</strong> the software used for viewing the lectures is called visimeet. It is available as a demo version for free download. However, the university has only one account that enables one to login to the “MAGIC room” in visimeet. Whenever someone log in using this account, all others currently logged in with this account get logged out automatically without warning. In short, you can not just install visimeet on your computer/laptop and watch MAGIC lectures from home or your office.</p>
